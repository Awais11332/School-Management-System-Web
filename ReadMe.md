üè´ School Management System (SMS Pro)

This is a professional, single-page School Management System (SMS) designed to showcase modern web development techniques using pure HTML, CSS (via Tailwind), and JavaScript.

The focus of this project is to deliver an aesthetically pleasing, feature-rich dashboard with a clean, animated, and responsive user interface, all contained within one file for simplicity.

‚ú® Features

Single-File Architecture: The entire application (HTML, CSS/Tailwind configuration, and JavaScript logic) is contained within index.html.

Professional & Magical Design: Styled using a custom Tailwind CSS configuration featuring a dark, sleek sidebar and a vibrant blue primary color palette.

Animated Navigation: A fully responsive, collapsible sidebar with smooth CSS transitions and a subtle glowing effect on the active link.

Client-Side Routing: Uses JavaScript's URL Hash (#dashboard, #students, etc.) for seamless, non-reloading navigation between views, providing a modern Single-Page Application (SPA) feel.

Dynamic Data Simulation: Mock data is used to populate various sections (Total Students, Staff, Fees, etc.), demonstrating how real data would be rendered.

Intuitive UI/UX: Custom CSS animations and magical hover effects, like the ripple effect on buttons and the lift-and-shadow on dashboard cards, enhance user interaction.

üöÄ Getting Started
